## Credits
This blog uses the [Reverie theme](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie). I modified the theme to use the [giscus](https://giscus.app/) commenting system, which is free and open source. For theme customization, I recommend this [blog](https://lazyren.github.io/devlog/use-utterances-for-jekyll-comments.html) by DaeIn Lee.
