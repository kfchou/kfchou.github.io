Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard proposed by Anthropic in November 2024 for connecting your AI assistants to your data sources. It standardizes _how_ a tool should be called by an LLM Agent, so that your agents can handle calls to different APIs. Additionally, MCP provides a comprehensive protocol that enables AI assistants to securely access both data resources and executable tools from various sources through a unified interface.

# Pre-MCP
Before MCP, building an AI agent required creating custom integrations for every data source or tool you wanted to use. Each integration meant writing specific code to handle authentication, API calls, data formatting, and error handling.

Let's look at a concrete example: building an AI agent that can work with Airtable data. Before MCP, you'd need to implement every Airtable operation manually:
```py
import requests
import json

class AirtableIntegration:
    def __init__(self, api_key, base_id):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_id = base_id
        self.headers = {
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    
    def list_records(self, table_name, view=None, fields=None):
        """Get records from a table with filtering and field selection"""
        url = f'https://api.airtable.com/v0/{self.base_id}/{table_name}'
        params = {}
        if view:
            params['view'] = view
        if fields:
            params['fields[]'] = fields
        
        response = requests.get(url, headers=self.headers, params=params)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise Exception(f"Airtable API error: {response.text}")
        return response.json()['records']
    
    def create_record(self, table_name, fields):
        """Create a new record in the specified table"""
        url = f'https://api.airtable.com/v0/{self.base_id}/{table_name}'
        data = {'records': [{'fields': fields}]}
        
        response = requests.post(url, headers=self.headers, json=data)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise Exception(f"Failed to create record: {response.text}")
        return response.json()['records'][0]
    
    def update_record(self, table_name, record_id, fields):
        """Update an existing record"""
        url = f'https://api.airtable.com/v0/{self.base_id}/{table_name}/{record_id}'
        data = {'fields': fields}
        
        response = requests.patch(url, headers=self.headers, json=data)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise Exception(f"Failed to update record: {response.text}")
        return response.json()
    
    def delete_record(self, table_name, record_id):
        """Delete a record"""
        url = f'https://api.airtable.com/v0/{self.base_id}/{table_name}/{record_id}'
        
        response = requests.delete(url, headers=self.headers)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise Exception(f"Failed to delete record: {response.text}")
        return True

# Usage in your AI agent
airtable = AirtableIntegration(api_key="your_key", base_id="your_base")

# Agent needs to know about all these methods and their parameters
def handle_user_request(request):
    if "add customer" in request:
        # Parse user input, extract fields, handle errors
        fields = parse_customer_data(request)
        return airtable.create_record("Customers", fields)
    elif "find customer" in request:
        # Handle search logic, filtering
        return airtable.list_records("Customers", view="All Customers")
    # ... handle all other operations

```
This approach has major drawbacks:
* Extensive boilerplate: Authentication, error handling, API versioning
* Maintenance overhead: Updates to Airtable's API require code changes
* Security complexity: Managing API keys, rate limits, permissions
* No standardization: Every integration follows different patterns

# Post-MCP
With MCP, instead of building custom integrations, you connect your AI assistant to standardized MCP servers. Let's see how the Airtable example transforms:

# Try it for yourself
Let's use a practical example to illustrate how you can make use of publicly available MCP servers.

You can find a list of pre-build MCP servers at https://mcpservers.org/ and https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers

1. Create a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` to define the MCP servers you want to use for the current project.
2. Click on the "Add Server" blue button. For this example, select **docker** and type in `mcp/time`. Hit **enter** and select **allow**.
3. In the agent chat panel, hit the restart button immediately above the chatbox. The `mcp/time` docker image will be downloaded and started in the background.
4. Now type `#` to bring up a list of command available to you. You'll see `get_current_time` and `convert_time`. Select `get_current_time`.
5. Ask the agent "what time is it in Amsterdam right now". In the backgroud, copilot will use the `mcp/time` server to fetch the correct time.

Interim conclusion - publically available MCP servers enable our AI agents to access tools, so it fetches more facts and reduces hallucinations. It enables additional actions, such as:
* Create an issue in github based on our conversation -> calls github API for you
* Grab me sales data for Q4 2024 -> queries your sql server (you may need to provide access tokens)



# How does it work?
At a high level, MCP involves three roles: the host, the client, and the server:‍
* The host is the AI-powered application (e.g., a chat assistant or AI-enhanced IDE) with which the end-user interacts.
* The client lives within the host, handling the MCP protocol for the host and maintains a dedicated connection to a server.
* The server is a separate program or service that provides specific capabilities (access to a database, a web search tool, a file system, etc.) via the standardized MCP interface.


A typical interaction across these roles might look like this:
1. AI Assistant (MCP Client) → "I need sales data for Q4 2024"
2. MCP Host/Server → Receives the request, authenticates, queries the PostgreSQL database
3. Database → Returns raw data to the MCP Host
4. MCP Host/Server → Formats the data according to MCP protocol and sends it back
5. AI Assistant (MCP Client) → Receives formatted data and generates the intelligent response

The MCP host/Client handles client interaction and language processing, while the MCP server handles tool execution and data access.


By March 2025, MCP became "the hottest topic in the AI space". 
Popular consumer IDEs like Cursor, Cline, and Goose officially supports MCP.



To use MCP, you need to set up a MCP server. This MCP server exposes tools...
