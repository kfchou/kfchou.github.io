title:  Setting up dev tools in linux
categories: [uv, tech stack]
excerpt: I wish installing these tools in linux were as simple as `brew/chocolatey/npm install xyz`.
---
Notes for myself.

Tools we'll set up are, in order:
1. uv
2. python
3. pipx
4. poetry & poetry-auto-export
5. nox

Assumptions:
* Your are on a linux cluster and you home directory has limited space. If not, then you may skip the `.bashrc` modifications.
* Your system's default Python version is out of date, or is unavailable.
* The projects you work on are configured to work with Poetry
* You need to keep `requirements.txt` synced with your `pyproject.toml` due to various reasons (e.g., for production)

# Set up your home directory
If you ever see "disk quota exceeded" issues, run `du -h --max-depth=1 ~` to inspect your home directory for large, space-hogging folders. One common offender is the `.cache` directory. Before we get started, set up a symlink for your home `.cache` directory in case of space restrictions:
```
ln -s my_unrestricted_dir/.cache ~/.cache
```

# Installing the tools
Important: in each of the following steps, run `source ~/.bashrc` to load in any changes you have made to the `.bashrc` file.

## 1. Install uv using the standalone installer.
We'll `uv` as our Python version manager. First, add this to your `.bashrc` file
```
# modify MY_HOME as you see fit
MY_HOME="/usr/<my_username>"
export UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR="$MY_HOME/uv/python"
```
Then install using the standalone installer. 
```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
For advance options, see the [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Verify the installation with
```
uv --version
```

If you run into `invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer solution` issues, run 
```
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt 
```
in console then try again.

## 2. Install python 3.10
I'm specifying the python version here due to the Poetry-auto-export dependecy requirements. It will work with Python versions 3.10 or higher.

The `--preview` option installs Python executables into your PATH:
```sh
uv python install 3.10 --preview
```
This will install a Python executable for the requested version into `~/.local/bin`, e.g., as `python3.10`

Lets verify the installation. Open a new terminal. Type
```sh
which python3.10
```
and this should return something like:
```
.local/bin/python3.10
```
## 3. (Optional) Install pipx
Modify pipx installation directory and where pipx installs packages by adding the following to your `.bashrc`:
```sh
export PIPX_BIN_DIR="$MY_HOME/pipx/bin"
export PIPX_HOME="$MY_HOME/pipx"
export PATH="$PIPX_BIN_DIR:$PATH"
```
Then install using Python 3.10. All actions made via `pipx` will use this Python version.
```sh
python3.10 -m pip install --user pipx
python3.10 -m pipx ensurepath # adds pipx to your path
sudo pipx ensurepath --global # optional to allow pipx actions with --global argument
```
Very the installation with
```
pipx --version
```

## 4. Install Poetry with the offical installer. 

We want to use python 3.10 or higher and Poetry version <2.0 due to the Poetry plugins we want to use.

Add to your `.bashrc`:
```sh
export POETRY_HOME=$MY_HOME/pypoetry
```

Then install Poetry, specifying the Poetry version and Python version:
```sh
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | POETRY_VERSION=1.8.4 python3.10 -
```
or if you want to use pipx
```sh
pipx install poetry==1.8.4 --python python3.10
```
verify with
```
poetry --version
```

## 5. Install `poetry-auto-export`
```sh
poetry self install poetry-auto-export
```
or if you use pipx
```sh
pipx inject poetry poetry-auto-export
```
verify with:
```
poetry self show plugins
```
you should see the above plugins listed.

## (Optional) 6. Install nox
Nox helps with testing and scripting
```
pipx install nox
```
verify with:
```
nox --version
```

## Bashrc changes
Your `.bashrc` should have the additional lines:
```
export MY_HOME="/<username>"

export POETRY_HOME=$MY_HOME/pypoetry
export PATH="$MY_HOME/pypoetry/bin:$PATH"

export PIPX_BIN_DIR="$MY_HOME/pipx/bin"
export PIPX_HOME="$MY_HOME/pipx"
export PATH="$PIPX_BIN_DIR:$PATH"

export UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR="$MY_HOME/uv/python"

# add bin directory to path
. "$HOME/.local/bin/env"
```

Hope these notes helped you set up your dev machine! I suppose the alternative is to publish a docker image with all these tools pre-installed, but is that really necessary?
