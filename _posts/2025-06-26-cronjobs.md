excerpt: A quick guide to setting up Cron jobs on your Linux machine, including tips for handling isolated environments.

So you want to set up a Cron Job on your linux machine? If you ask Google, all you'll get is "Open `crontab -e`" and add `0 0 * * 0 /path/to/your/command`

But what if the job you want to run is slightly more complicated? This post is intended to be a quick guide, for the lazy (like myself) who don't want to read the [Cron Guide](https://cronitor.io/guides/cron-jobs) in its entirety.

Let's get started!

1. Create a script for the job you want to run, we'll call it with cron: `touch /path/to/your/script.sh`
2. Make your script executable: `sudo chmod +X /path/to/your/script.sh`
3. Run `sudo crontab -e` to edit your Cron job file.
4. Set up a test job -- add the following to the end of the Cron file: `* * * * * su - <user.name> -c 'cd /home/<user.name>/ && /path/to/your/script.sh' >> /tmp/script-output.log 2>&1`
   
   Explanation:
   `* * * * *` runs your job every minute, and `>> /tmp/script-output.log 2>&1` logs the output
   cronjob runs as `root` by default, and will not have access to your configs and settings. `su - <user.name>` runs the cronjob as the user you specify.

5. **Cron runs in an isolated environment** with very little access to the tools you've installed. In your `script.sh`, you need to give cron the tools it needs for code execution:

    ```bash
    # Give it access to PATHs
    HOME="<your profile's home directory>"
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:$PATH"

    # Set environment variables so cron has access to tools and configs. For example:
    export GH_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.config/gh"
    source $HOME/.bashrc

    # add some information for logging purposes
    current_datetime=$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)
    echo "current time is {$current_datetime}"

    # You can call a complicated set of commands with a Makefile target - e.g., build and deploy a container.
    make test_cronjob
    ```

6. Examine the log to check whether your job is successful: `sudo cat /tmp/script-output.log`
7. Once your test job is successful, edit your Cron file or scripts to call the actual job you want to run.
8. Update the job execution frequency from  `* * * * *` to something more reasonable, like `0 0 * * 0` (every Sunday at midnight).

Hope that saved you a few minutes of Googling.
