title:  An ode to uv

After using uv for a couple months, it continues to impress. It's fast. It's easy to use. But it can't replace tools like poetry completely. Perhaps the main reason is because I cannot just completely change up the workflow for existing projects. Most projects I work with uses Poetry as backend. This post will explain how I make use of both Poetry and uv in my workflows.

# Installation
There are [many ways](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#cargo) to install uv. I prefer to use one of these methods:
```bash
# Standalone installer 
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# pipx
pipx install nox

# brew
brew install uv
```

## Advanced settings for linux servers
If you're working on linux servers, you may have do adjust some settings due to the limited amount of disk space available in the home directory.

Add the following to your `.bashrc`
```bash
export UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=my_python_install_dir
```
See additional settings for `uv` in the [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/#uv_python_install_dir).

By default, `uv` will also utilize your `~/.cache` directory. So I recommend creating a symlink to a directory that's not space-restricted.
```bash
ln -s my_unrestricted_dir/.cache ~/.cache
```
> ! If you run into `invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer solution` issues, run `export SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` in console then try again. ([source](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1819))

# Python Management
uv replaces `pyenv`

You don't have to explicitly install python versions, since uv will download any missing python versions for you. But sometimes, it's good to be explicit.
```bash
# Install one or more python versions
uv python install 3.11 3.12

# View python installations
uv python list
```
Python binaries managed by uv lives in a specific directory. You can control where Python interpreters are installed using the `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable. See other fine-grained control you have in the [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/#uv_python).

# Environment management
uv replaces `virtualenv`

```bash
# explicitly set up an environment.
uv venv <path/myenv> --python 3.11

source <path/myenv>/bin/activate
```
Why use uv for environment management? Primarily because it can also act as a Python version manager. It quickly downloads python interpreters if they aren't found on your system. I've compared uv with other common environment managers [here](./2024-10-26-uv-virtual-env-tools.md).

# Install packages
uv replaces `pip`

uv is much faster than pip and poetry. Can we use it to install a Poetry-managed project? Absolutely, yes!

In my workflow, I generate `requirement.txt` files because it doesn't make sense to include poetry in production. This is done automatically with [poetry-auto-export](https://github.com/Ddedalus/poetry-auto-export). With poetry-auto-export installed, new requirement files are generated every time `poetry.lock` file is updated.

Since uv is a drop-in replacement for pip, we can call
```bash
# install your dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# install the current project
uv pip install . --no-deps
```

If you don't have poetry-auto-export, you can manually export the requirement files (or [write a script](https://mil.ad/blog/2024/uv-poetry-install.html) that does it for you).

In situations where you have to install packages over and over again, uv can significantly speed up your workflow. Such as...
* Running tests with [nox/tox](2024-11-09-pytest-nox-uv.md). In these situations, packages are installed in fresh environments, which are destroyed after the test finishes.
* During CI workflows -- see [Using uv in Github Actions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/github/). Use uv to install both Python and your requirements!

# Summary
These are by no means the full extent of uv's capabilities. It replaces `pipx`. It can manage entire projects, build and publish packages. I haven't yet used uv for these tasks, but I'll update this post once I do.
